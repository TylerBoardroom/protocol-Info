# [Name of DAO] Weekly Update

## Weekly Forum Summary

Weekly forum summaries are where Scribes give members of their DAO a rundown of what's happened in their governance forums each week and provide links to join the discussion. They are split into three sections: the TLDR, new discussions, and ongoing discussions.

To start this section, copy and paste the above section title and give a short TLDR summary of what's important to know. 

### New Discussions

New discussions are threads that have started the week of the update. 

Use the above sub-section title and format the links as seen below (copy and paste from the Template doc in this folder).

| Name          | Category      | Link   |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
| Name of Post | Category | [Discuss](Link to Forum post)

These are the categories to choose from:

- Treasury: posts about using a DAO's treasury, e.g. a proposal to spend funds or how to manage the treasury
- Development: posts about development-related topics, e.g. proposed changes to parameters of a DeFi protocol
- Meta: posts about the governance of the DAO
- Meta-Governance (if applicable): posts about participating in the governance of another DAO
- Operations: posts about staffing, organizational workstreams, etc. 
- Marketing: posts about marketing for the DAO
- Strategy: posts about overall strategy of the DAO
- Product: posts about the product of the DAO
- Other: everything else

Note: sometimes forum posts are best described with two categories, e.g. Product/Development or Marketing/Strategy

After you fill in the table, add a short (100 words max) description under the table.

### Ongoing Discussions

Ongoing discussions are threads that started before the week of the update but were substantively added to during the week of the update. 

These are organized the same way as New Discussions. 

## Other Updates

This section of the Weekly Update is for adding anything else members of a DAO need to know. Scribes can format these however they like, but below are some suggestions on the type of things to include:

- Topics discussed in the Discord, with links. 
- Twitter threads about the DAO worth highlighting.
- News mentions of the DAO
- Etc.
