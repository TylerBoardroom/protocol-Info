| [ARC] Deepen cooperation with Yearn | Strategy | [View](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deepen-cooperation-with-yearn/2831) |

The sentiment poll results are 53% against 47% in favor. The proposal implies several risk modifications; (1) increased systemic risk (2) Increased liquidity risk (3) Reduced income and influence of Aave (no YFI borrowing, borrow rate at -17% of the protocolâ€™s rate).
There is no obvious interest for Aave.

| Proposal: Introduce Liquidity Incentives for Aave v2 | Strategy | [View](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-introduce-liquidity-incentives-for-aave-v2/2340/27) |

The sentiment poll results are 62% in favor of liquidity mining, 38% against with 70 votes in total. Most of the contributors in comments are against the proposal which seems unnecessary to them.
Anjan from ParaFi provided details; (1) we will need the % of token to distribute during LM (2) a 10 days vesting schedule is planned (3) the reward will be distributed to DAI, USDT, USDC, WBTC, and ETH liquidity providers.

Gauntlet works with the Aave team to optimize risk parameter for V2 assets ; loan to value, liquidation threshold, liquidation incentive values for various assets.
They suggest to reduce the risk limits on YFI and increasing risk limits on WBTC. The full report will be published in a near future.
