| [ARC] Deepen cooperation with Yearn | Strategy | [View](https://governance.aave.com/t/arc-deepen-cooperation-with-yearn/2831) |

Yearn team proposed to “strengthen the symbiotic relationship between Aave and Yearn”. Yearn will deposit 1,000 freshly minted YFI on Aave and the protocol will offer few modifications in exchange; (1) disable borrowing YFI, (2) settle a fixed interest facility of 3% for Yearn Treasury borrow, with a loan-to-value of 65% (3) add a CTA redirecting to Yearn on Aave.

Binance Chain is the third most used blockchain which gather many new adopters, implementing Aave on the BSC will onboard many incoming users. Community seems strongly opposed to a moove to the BSC.
