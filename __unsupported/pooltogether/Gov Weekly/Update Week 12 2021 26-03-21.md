An initial [workbook](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/pool-token-airdrop-for-pod-users-who-should-have-qualified/269/34) has been completed to try and derive the total pool owed to qualifying individuals who did not recieve the airdrop.
A [developer is now needed to review](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/pool-token-airdrop-for-pod-users-who-should-have-qualified/269/36) the workbook before moving forward to a PTIP.
