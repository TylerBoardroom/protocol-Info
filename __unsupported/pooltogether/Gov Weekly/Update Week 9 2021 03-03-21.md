| Slow the Dai and USDC POOL distribution rates to match COMP and UNI pools | Strategy/Product | [Vote](https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/1) |

Slow the Dai and USDC POOL distribution rates to match the COMP and UNI ones, (down from 2,295 POOL per day to 255 POOL per day). This will serve to lengthen the period of deposits rewards and extend them well past the original ~85 day period.

| POOL Depositor Distribution | Treasury | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/pool-depositor-distribution/551) |

Discussion to edit POOL Depositor Distribution by:
1) Slowing the Dai and USDC POOL distribution rates to match the COMP and UNI ones, (down from 2,295 POOL per day to 255 POOL per day).
2) Removing the time countdowns from the UI, signaling that the distribution is intended to run perpetually
3) Creating a separate proposal to divert 1,000 POOL per week to a prize pool for POOL holders. This is more likely to have the intended effect of giving more POOL to the people long term aligned.

| Is PoolTogether another Bitconnect? | Strategy | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/is-pooltogether-another-bitconnect/479) |

To make PoolTogether a more open and transparent organization this Discussion poses the following thoughts/suggestions:
1) a central organization supporting a decentralized one.
2) Organization details and address information on the front page of the site
3) Proudly show the founders or at least the executives that represent the organization - someone is pulling the strings
4) Post paid job opportunities
5) Have contact information for getting support through traditional channels
6) Actual LinkedIn page
7) Clearly have third party audit agencies information on the front page - don’t bury it
8) Moitor Discord 24/7

| Give POOL token more utility | Marketing | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/give-pool-token-more-utility/174) |

Aims to increase value of POOL by giving token more utility  
People could enter the same amount of POOL as they do DAI into the lottery. Giving them more chances to win the DAI interest. This would incentivize people to Buy/Hodl POOL and increase it’s price over time.

| Adding a utility token to the Pooltogether ecosystem | Product | [Discuss](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/new-pool-proposal-adding-a-utility-token-to-the-pooltogether-ecosystem/440)|

This proposal to add the Kokoon token to Pooltogether has three main intentions:
1) Create a pool with a custom prize strategy that captures 25% of the interest earned.
2) Distribute the Kokoon token via liquidity mining of the pool.
3) Users stake their KKN tokens to receive a share of the captured interest.
